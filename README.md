> [!IMPORTANT]
> This OS will have a strong focus for developers, and some tools they may use.

> [!NOTE]
> Believe it or not, this OS is not actually ready yet. When it is ready, this page will be changed.

> [!TIP]
> We recommend that you either run Nebulatic OS on a virtual machine like [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/), or make a bootable USB drive that has Nebulatic OS on it using something like [Rufus](https://rufus.ie/) or [Etcher](https://etcher.balena.io/) if you do not have plans to use this operating system on your main drive.
